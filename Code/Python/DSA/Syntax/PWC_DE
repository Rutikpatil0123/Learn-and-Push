1. Given an integer array, find the sum of the largest contiguous subarray within the array.
 For example, if the input is [−1, −3, 5, −4, 3, −6, 9, 2], then return 11 (because of [9, 2]). Note that if all the elements are negative, you should return 0.

2. Write a function smallest_multiple to find the smallest number that is perfectly divisible (i.e. no remainder) by all numbers from 1 to the target number.

3. Given an input list containing n distinct numbers in the range 0 to n, return the only number in the range that is missing from the list.
 For example, given input = [0,1,3], return 2. Because the input list has 3 elements in it, we expect to see the numbers 0 to 3 in there, but 2 is missing.

4. Write a Python function max_three(input) that prints all unique combinations of three distinct elements from a given list input.
 The function should generate combinations in the format (element1, element2, element3).

5. You are tasked with writing a Python function max_three(input) that calculates the maximum product of three distinct elements from a given list input.
 Your function should efficiently find and return this maximum product.
